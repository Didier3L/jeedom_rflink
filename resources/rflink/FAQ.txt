RFLink Latest Firmware Version

Q: Where can I find RFlink firmware versions:

A: The latest firmware version can be downloaded from:  
Sourceforge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/rflink/files/latest/download   
  
Please note that the RFLink Gateway is a freeware project.   
Stuntteam is not making money in any way.   
This means that there are no unlimited funds to purchase test devices,   
it also means the project has to rely on you, the user, to send debug data.  
  
If you want to contribute to this project, you can send a donation which is more than welcome (see www.nemcon.nl/blog2 donation button),   
or help with sending debug data of unsupported devices (you can even write and contribute plugins and/or code fixes),  
or donate the device that you would like to see supported.  
   
Right now we are looking for some older remotes and/or switches.  
Like for example: Blyss, Home Confort, Conrad, Kambrook etc.   
For the implementation of the planned 2.4Ghz support we could use some simple MySensor devices.   
For extending 868Mhz support we could use some devices as well.   
If you have anything that you do not use, send a mail to frankzirrone@gmail.com
Thanks in advance!

Synology NAS:  

Q: What do I need to use RFlink on a Synology NAS?

A: If you want to use RFLink with a Synology NAS you can use:  
- an Arduino Mega clone based on CH340 USB/serial chip  
In all other cases:  
- connect a 10 uF capacitor between reset and ground on the Arduino.   
  Simply stick the pins of the capacitor in the power connector socket.  
  When you want to update the firmware of the Arduino, remove the capacitor and reconnect it when done.

Note for blinds controllers:   

Q: How to use RFLink with Domoticz and a blinds controller?

A: When using RFlink in combination with Domoticz and a Bofu, Brell or A OK blind controller,   
Domoticz will detect the remote control commands and create switch devices.   
Add the detected remote command as switch and then change the generated switch to a ventian blind.   
This will give you an icon with up/stop/down options.   
Once you have done this, you can control the blind from Domoticz.
